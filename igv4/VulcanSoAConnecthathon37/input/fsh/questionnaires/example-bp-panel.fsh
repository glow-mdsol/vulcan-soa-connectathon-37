During clinical encounters 2 or more BPs should be averaged to more accurately assess a person's BP status.  When patients are self-monitoring blood pressure (SMBP), the American Heart Association recommends a minimum of 12 readings collected over at least 3 days should be averaged to more accurately assess a person's BP status (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000087, PMID: 30827125).  According to the European Society of Hypertension , \"The adverse cardiovascular consequences of hypertension, including events and mortality, largely depend on increased average BP values. Thus, decision-making in hypertension is based on average values of several BP readings obtained in and out of the office\" (https://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/Fulltext/2021/07000/2021_European_Society_of_Hypertension_practice.5.aspx, PMID: 33710173)."
